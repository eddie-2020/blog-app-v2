# Blog_App_With_Rails
This Blog app is a classic example of a blog website. I will be creating a full functional website that will show the list of posts and empower readers to interact with them by adding comments and liking posts.

## Milestone-1
- For each URL you should create:
  - A route.
  - An action in the correct controller.
  - A view file.
- View files should include only placehoulders written in plain HTML, e.g:
  - Here is a list of post for a given user

## Clone Project
- STEP 1:
  - git clone `git@github.com:oluyaratosin123/Blog_App_With_Rails.git`
- STEP 2:
  - `cd Blog_App_With_Rails` in your terminal
- STEP 3:
  - run `rails server` or `rails s` in your terminal
- STEP 4:
  - visit `localhost:3000` on your browser
> Yeyyy you have the app running **Congratulations** ðŸ˜…ðŸŽ‰
